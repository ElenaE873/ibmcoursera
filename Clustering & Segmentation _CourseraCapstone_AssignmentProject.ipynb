    "A DataFrame is a table much like in SQL or Excel. It's similar in structure, too, making it possible to use similar operations such as aggregation, filtering, and pivoting. However, because DataFrames are built in Python, it's possible to use Python to program more advanced operations and manipulations than SQL and Excel can offer. As a bonus, the creators of pandas have focused on making the DataFrame operate very quickly, even over large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames are particularly useful because powerful methods are built into them. In Python, methods are associated with objects, so you need your data to be in the DataFrame to use these methods. DataFrames can load data through a number of different data structures and files, including lists and dictionaries, csv files, excel files, and database records (more on that here).\n"
